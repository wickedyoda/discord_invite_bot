# 🔗 Discord Invite Role Bot

## 🎯 Overview
This is a Discord bot that allows server admins to generate invite links that automatically assign a role to users when they join the server. The bot is designed to work both for new members and existing members who need access to protected channels.

## 💡 Key Features
- Slash command `/setrole` to assign the role to use.
- Slash command `/createinvite` to generate a permanent invite link.
- Slash command `/getaccess` for existing users to claim the access role.
- Automatically assigns role to users who join using the permanent invite.
- Persistent storage of the selected role and invite link.
