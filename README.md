# 🔐 Discord Invite Role Bot

This bot allows select Discord users to create **role-bound invite links** and **6-digit access codes** that assign roles automatically to new or existing users. The system supports slash commands and permission control via role checks.

---

## 💡 Features

- Slash command `/submitrole`:
  - Asks the user for a role.
  - Generates a 6-digit code (with no more than 2 consecutive digits).
  - Creates a permanent invite link.
  - Assigns the submitted role to:
    - Users joining through the invite.
    - Existing users who submit the generated code via `/enter_role`.

- Slash command `/enter_role`:
  - Prompts the user for a 6-digit code and assigns the matching role.

- `/submitrole`: Submit a role, get an invite and access code.
- `/enter_role`: Enter the 6-digit code to receive the corresponding role.
- `/getaccess`: Public command to assign a preconfigured access role.
- Only users with the **Employee** role can run role-submitting commands.
- **Admins** and **Gl.iNet Moderators** get full access to manage all bot commands.
- Invite-based role assignment works for new members who join via generated links.
- Tag-based auto-replies for messages like `!betatest`, configurable via `data/tag_responses.json`.
- Tag-based auto-replies are also available as slash commands (e.g., `/betatest`).
- `!list` message to display available tag commands.
- Search commands:
  - Combined: `/search`, `!search`
  - Forum only: `/search_forum`, `!searchforum`
  - KVM docs only: `/search_kvm`, `!searchkvm`
  - IoT docs only: `/search_iot`, `!searchiot`
  - Router v4 docs only: `/search_router`, `!searchrouter`
- Country nickname commands:
  - Set: `/country`, `!country` (example: `US`)
  - Clear: `/clear_country`, `!clearcountry`
- Moderation commands (moderators only):
  - `/kick_member`, `!kickmember` (kicks and prunes 72h messages)
  - `/timeout_member`, `!timeoutmember` (duration like `30m`, `2h`, `1d`)
  - `/modlog_test`, `!modlogtest` (sends a test moderation log message)
  - All moderation actions are logged to a configured logs channel.

## 🧠 How It Works

### ➤ 1. Role Submission Flow

An authorized user types `/submitrole`.  
The bot will:
- Ask the user to mention a role.
- Generate:
  - A **permanent invite link**
  - A **6-digit access code** (no more than 2 identical digits in a row)
- Log the invite/code → role association.
- Return the invite and code to the user privately.

### ➤ 2. Role Access by Code

Any member can type `/enter_role`. The bot will prompt them privately for the
6-digit code. After they submit it, the bot assigns the associated role if the
code is valid.

### ➤ 3. Automatic Role Assignment via Invite

If someone joins the server via a generated invite, the bot will automatically assign the associated role.

### ➤ 4. Manual Role Access

All users can run `/getaccess` to receive the default access role defined in `access_role.txt`.

### ➤ 5. Tag-Based Auto Replies

You can configure short tag responses (like `!betatest`) in `data/tag_responses.json`. When a user sends a message that starts with a configured tag, the bot replies with the preset response.
Each tag is also registered as a slash command (for example, `!betatest` becomes `/betatest`) on startup.

Example file contents:
```json
{
  "!betatest": "✅ Thanks for your interest in the beta! We'll share more details soon.",
  "!support": "🛠️ Need help? Please open a ticket or message a moderator."
}
```

To add more later, edit the JSON file and add new keys for each tag. Changes are picked up automatically without restarting the bot.

### ➤ 6. Command Listing

Send `!list` in a channel to get a list of configured tag commands from `data/tag_responses.json`.

### ➤ 7. Forum Search

Use these commands:
- `/search` or `!search` for all sources combined.
- `/search_forum` or `!searchforum` for forum-only search.
- `/search_kvm` or `!searchkvm` for KVM docs only.
- `/search_iot` or `!searchiot` for IoT docs only.
- `/search_router` or `!searchrouter` for Router v4 docs only.

Search sources:
- [forum.gl-inet.com](https://forum.gl-inet.com/)
- [docs.gl-inet.com/kvm/en](https://docs.gl-inet.com/kvm/en/)
- [docs.gl-inet.com/iot/en](https://docs.gl-inet.com/iot/en/)
- [docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/4](https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/4/)

The bot returns top matching links for the selected source(s).

### ➤ 8. Country of Origin Nickname

Users can add a country code suffix to their nickname with:
- `/country US`
- `!country US`

This updates their server nickname to end with ` - US` (space, dash, space, 2-letter code).
To remove it, use:
- `/clear_country`
- `!clearcountry`

### ➤ 9. Moderation Commands

- `/kick_member @user [reason]` or `!kickmember @user [reason]`
  - Kicks the user and prunes their messages from the last 72 hours.
- `/timeout_member @user <duration> [reason]` or `!timeoutmember @user <duration> [reason]`
  - Timeouts for a duration like `30m`, `2h`, or `1d` (up to 28 days).
- `/modlog_test` or `!modlogtest`
  - Sends a test moderation log message to verify log channel delivery.
- Moderation log channel:
  - Controlled by `MOD_LOG_CHANNEL_ID` (default: `1311820410269995009`)
  - Logs include moderator, action, target, outcome, reason, and details.
