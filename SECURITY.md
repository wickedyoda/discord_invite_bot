# Security Policy

This repository is maintained with a security-first posture for bot runtime, web admin access, and stored operational data.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for:

- `main` branch (latest)
- Most recent tagged release

Older releases are best-effort only and may not receive backported fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities privately to:

- `wicked@wickedyoda.com`

Please include:

- Affected version/commit
- Reproduction steps
- Impact description
- Proposed mitigation (if available)

Do not open public issues for unpatched security vulnerabilities.

## Disclosure Process

- Reports are reviewed privately.
- Fixes are prepared and tested before public disclosure when feasible.
- Public disclosure should happen only after a fix or mitigation is available.

## Security and Privacy Baseline

Aligned with the WickedYoda site privacy and policy statement at:

- `https://wickedyoda.com/?page_id=3`

Project principles:

- No intentional sale of user data.
- Data use is limited to operational needs (bot/web admin functionality, security, and diagnostics).
- Sensitive data exposure should be minimized in logs, reports, and screenshots.

## Scope Notes

- Third-party services, plugins, and external platforms (for example Discord and other integrations) have their own security/privacy policies.
- Issues originating in third-party systems should still be reported, and will be triaged for project-side mitigations.
